// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

planning
AnalysisOfRequirements
design
development
testing
implementation
maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisOfRequirements = "gathering all of the specificmdetails required for a new system as determining the first ideas for prototypes."
const design = "outlining the details for the overall application, alongside aspects like user interfaces, system interfaces, network and their requirements, and databases."
const development = "this is the part where developers begin to actually write code and build the application according to the earlier design documents and outlined specifications."
const testing = "not the end. Now it must be tested to make sure that there aren't any bugs and that the end-user will not negatively be affected at any point."
const implementation = "After testing, the overall design will come together. Different modules or designs will be integrated into the primary source code through developer efforts, attempting to detect further errors and defects."
const maintain = "implementing any changes that the software might need after deployment, including things like handling residual bug problems that weren't able to be patched before launch, or new issues that appear from user reports."
